                     3. Drop out leaners.
                     Cause the challenge: Each School has a large number of students.
                     Less pass rate in Sciences and technology because of less pretcails in high school and college.
                     No moretivel speaks in school around final Exam time or friends infuse.
                     Why should it be fixing: To educate more young people and give them skill of life which is 
                     education. People with education have more chances in life and with this lap being build it will help

         <p>The Community Library consists of seven staff members and a limited space and stock to serve such huge communities. They only have five smartcape computers for public to use, with 45 minutes session per person. They have a very small corner for youth called Teen Zone, with no computers nor space for youth activities. They also have a nice small section for kids, where they do their story telling and other activities, in this area they can only accommodate a small amount of kids.</p>
