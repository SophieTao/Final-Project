            <p>"iX is an amazing summer program that spends 4 weeks intensively teaching web development and 4 weeks at an internship at a local tech company with amazing excursions and adventures on the weekends. It's so hard to get a similar internship in America, so this opportunity was really valuable. During my internship I learned a lot about the startup culture and how a company like these work. "</p>

            <p>&quot;iX was a really great experience where I was able to learn and see a lot in a small period of time while having the opportunity to see another culture. During internship I learnt all about the the business implications of building software for a client. The process from start to finish was really cool to see. I also learnt a lot about code itself, the guys I worked with were proper gurus and I was able to learn a lot of things that I was personally interested in like front end frameworks.&quot;</p>

    <p><strong><%=markdown"The educational opportunities for children in Khayelitsha are vanishingly slim. Among 64 schools and one collage in Khayelitsha, each school has about 1300 students. In 2011, only 20 students (.04 percent) went on to study at the University of Cape Town.  
Problems: 1.Shortage of educational opportunities

 2. Sciences and technology lap

 3. Drop out leaners.

Cause the challenge: Each School has a large number of students.

Less pass rate in Sciences and technology because of less pretcails in high school and college.

No moretivel speaks in school around final Exam time or friends infuse.

Why should it be fixing: To educate more young people and give them skill of life which is 

education. People with education have more chances in life and with this lap being build it will help 

them to understand more about the subject him/her doing in school."%></strong>

<%=markdown"As we know Khayelitsha has high number young inside it, which has 6 different cultures delimiting.

This entire young people have talent into different act skills e.g. dancer, drawing & etc. This area has 

many act & culters groups which own by young people.

We have fond same challenges as follow: 1. No theatre

Causes the challenges: Ignores to our government about theatre and some young people never 

teaches about their culture. Language issue depend to family lessons when youâ€™re growing up or you 

not wanting to leaner."%>
